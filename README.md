# fizzbuzz

As part of my course at Thinkful I built a FizzBuzz app from scratch. 

In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let’s say 100). For each number if it’s not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. If it’s divisible by 3, instead of the number you say “fizz”. If it’s divisible by 5, you say “buzz”. And finally if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, you say “fizz buzz”. So, counting from 1 to 15, you’d say: “1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizz buzz”.

The point of this exercise was to build my programming skills and not spend any time on the UX (much to my horror) and the minimum requirement was an HTML file and a JavaScript file. The HTML file should link to jQuery and to your application JavaScript file. The program should append each number (or its “fizz”/”buzz”/”fizzbuzz” substitution) to the body element of the DOM (On the page).
